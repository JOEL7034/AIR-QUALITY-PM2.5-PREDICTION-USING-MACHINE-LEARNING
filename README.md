# AIR-QUALITY-PM2.5-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict PM2.5 air pollution levels using weather and geographical data. The focus is on understanding the complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, rather than only model training.
